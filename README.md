Key Components
Business Process
The primary business process involves managing Okhai's marketing campaign with a focus on promoting the new collection.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
Advertisement spending capped at INR 100,000.
Minimum of 15 online and 15 print ads.
The number of online ads must be at least as great as the number of print ads.

**Scenario Definition**
The project uses linear programming to determine the optimal mix of online and print advertisements to maximize customer reach. The scenario takes into account budget constraints, ad costs, and estimated audience reach.

**What-If Analysis Techniques**
Scenario Manager: Used to explore best-case and worst-case scenarios for the ad mix, while keeping the budget constant.
Data Table: Provides a visual analysis of ad combinations that remain within or exceed the budget.
Solver Implementation

- A linear programming solver was used to:
  - Maximize reach by determining the optimal number of online and print ads.
  - Stay within the defined budget while ensuring all constraints are met.
  - Data Visualization
  
- The project employs multiple charts to present the results:
  - Total Cost vs. Customer Reach: Highlights the correlation between spending and customer reach
  - Online Ads vs. Print Ads: Total Reach Over Time: Compares the effectiveness of online and print ads.
  - Budget Surplus/Deficit: Shows budget fluctuations over time.
  - Online Ads vs. Print Ads Over Time: Illustrates the consistent preference for online ads.
    
- Database Management
 The project uses SQL to manage campaign data. SQL queries can help filter, sort, and analyze the advertisement data based on budget and reach criteria.

**Recommendations**
Optimal Strategy: Run 293 online ads and 15 print ads to maximize reach within the INR 100,000 budget.
Flexibility: The analysis shows additional viable ad combinations that could be used if adjustments are needed.

**Conclusion**
This campaign provides a comprehensive strategy for Okhai to promote its sustainable fashion collection effectively. The use of linear programming, what-if analysis, and solver tools ensures the campaign remains efficient, cost-effective, and aligned with the company's goals of promoting ethical fashion. Following the recommended ad mix will likely lead to increased brand awareness and sales, making Okhai a top choice for eco-conscious consumers.
